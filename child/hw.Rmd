> **Due**: `r due`
>
> **Weight**: This assignment is worth 3% of your final grade.
>
> **Purpose**: `r params$purpose`
>
> **Assessment**: Each question indicates the % of the assignment grade, summing to 100%. The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:
>
> - 0% for not attempting a response.
> - 50% for attempting the question but with _major_ errors.
> - 75% for attempting the question but with _minor_ errors.
> - 100% for correctly answering the question.
>
> **Rules**:
>
> - Problems marked **SOLO** may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.
> - For problems marked **COLLABORATIVE**, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work -- everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together.
> - Even though you work collaboratively, you still must submit your own solutions.
